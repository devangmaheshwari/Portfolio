# Portfolio
This portfolio website is structured to provide a comprehensive view of my professional profile and includes features such as light and dark mode themes, navigation, and various sections dedicated to different aspects of my portfolio.
*Light and Dark Modes:*
The light.css and dark.css files define the styles for the website's light and dark modes, respectively. The light mode uses brighter colors and is the default theme when the website loads. The dark mode, activated via a button in the navigation bar, uses darker colors to provide a different visual experience. The JavaScript file (javas.js) handles the functionality for switching between these themes.
